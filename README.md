# YATT (Yet Another Task Tracker)

Urgh... as the name suggests, this repository contains source code for a task tracker. To make things more fun (for me), I will implement this with great help from LLMs, starting with free version of ChatGPT, but who knows where I will end up.

## Features

The initial prompt to ChatGPT was as follows:

```markdown
A comprehensive web-based task tracker application with advanced organization and customization features:
- Task grouping functionality
- Assignee system for task responsibility
- Customizable task states defined by assigned individuals
- User-defined task properties (e.g., due date, customer name, details)
- Task groups displayed as interactive tables
- Drag-and-drop column reordering with user-specific persistence
- Alphabetical sorting capability for tasks within each column
- Multi-user support with individualized column order preferences

UI/Style:
- Modular design with collapsible task groups and expandable task details
- Intuitive drag-and-drop interfaces for both tasks and columns
- Color-coded task states and priority levels for at-a-glance status assessment
